    <h2> Who Are We?</h2>
    <fal-head>Fal</fal-head>
    <p>From the lands of Here Be Dragons, or more simply Western Mass, Fal is
      your genderfluid member of Nightlite. They tend to be a bit of smartass
      which involve improv lines to games and swear like a motherfucking sailor.
      Fal will generally play any kind of game and is often the comic relief or
      the voice of (sometimes purposefully misguided) reason.

    <lgend-head> Legend </lgend-head>
    <p>Legend is a Southern New Hampshire resident who can be slightly crazy.
      She don't like horror games, but can put up with some of them to a degree.
      Although she has a rather calm demeanor, she can say and do abnormal or chaotic
      things when put in a certain situation, whether voicing a character or in general.
      Legend is usually used for either in game sound effects, especially for sick people
      (to Fal's dismay).
